### Issue:
- **Unproductive Meetings:** Meetings often lack focus and structure, leading to inefficient use of time and resources.
- **Ineffective Meeting Notes:** Traditional meeting notes provide only a summary of the current meeting, missing critical insights and connections to previous discussions.

### Current Solution:
- **Meeting Assistants:** Tools that assist in note-taking and summarizing meeting discussions.

### Pitfall of Current Solution:
