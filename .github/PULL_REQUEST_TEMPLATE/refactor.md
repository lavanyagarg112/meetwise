## Refactor: [Short Descriptive Title of Area Refactored]

**Description:**

Describe the code that was refactored and the motivation behind the changes. 

* **What changed?** Briefly explain the specific areas of the codebase that were refactored (e.g., "Refactored the authentication module to use a more modular design."). 
* **Why?**  Clearly articulate the reasons behind the refactoring. Was it to:
    * Improve code readability? 
    * Enhance performance?
    * Reduce code duplication?
    * Prepare for a new feature? 
* **Impact:** Does this refactoring affect any public APIs, user interfaces, or external dependencies?

**Related Issue:**

**Technical Details (Optional):**

If the refactoring involved complex changes or introduced new concepts, provide a concise explanation:

* **Approach:**  Briefly outline the techniques or patterns used (e.g., "Applied the Strategy Pattern to decouple payment processing logic.").
* **Key Changes:**  List out any major code movements, file renames, or new abstractions introduced.

**Testing:**

Reassure reviewers that the refactoring hasn't introduced regressions. 

* **Test Coverage:**  Specify the types of tests you ran to validate the changes (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
* **Regression Prevention:**  Explain how you ensured that existing functionality remains unaffected (e.g., "All existing tests were passing after the refactoring.").

**Checklist:**

- [ ] The code is well-documented.
- [ ] I have added unit tests or updated existing ones to cover the refactored code.
- [ ] The changes adhere to the project's coding style guidelines.
