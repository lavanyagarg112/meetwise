Summary:
Here is a summary of the key discussion points and decisions made during the meeting:

**Key Discussion Points:**

* The SEC (Secure and Govern Growth) team and the Data Science team (formerly Model Ops) are merging to create a new team, with the goal of secure and governing growth, including data science, AI, and anti-abuse.
* The team will include three groups from Model Ops (formerly) and one group from Anti-Abuse.
* At some point, Anti-Abuse may be split into two groups, but this is not planned in the near term.
* The team will work through changes to Workday and Handbook to implement the new structure.

**Decisions Made:**

* Alan has agreed to step in as Acting Full Stack Manager for Security Policies while a new EM is hired.
* The team will assume that leaders on the team will attend the meeting or read the notes, rather than relying on the Slack channel.

**Future Actions:**

* [To be determined]: Improved summarized communications to the team to reduce noise and improve signal-to-noise ratio.
* [To be determined]: Review and implementation of handbook and Workday changes to support the new team structure.
