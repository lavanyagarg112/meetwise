Summary:
Here is a summary of the meeting in a bulleted list, including key discussion points and decisions:

**Summary of Meeting: SEC, Data Science, and Anti-Abuse Team Meeting (September 14 or 15th in APAC)**

* **Changes in the meeting format**: The leader of the meeting mentioned that they will work to provide more summarized communications to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and will assume that people leaders on the team will attend the meeting or read the notes, rather than relying on the Slack channel.
* **New Acting Full Stack Manager for Security Policies**: Alan has been asked to step in as acting full stack manager for security policies while the current manager hires an Engineering Manager (EM). Alan has accepted this role.
* **Reorganization of Anti-Abuse Product Sections**: Anti-Abuse is moving product sections from SEC to Data Science. Data Science is a rename of the Model Ops section, which will include three existing groups and the Anti-Abuse group. There are plans to split the Anti-Abuse group into two groups in the future, but that is not in the near term.
* **Workday and Handbook Changes**: There will be changes to Workday and the company handbook as a result of the reorganization.
* **Next Steps**: The leader of the meeting will provide more information on the reorganization and changes in subsequent meetings.

**Decisions Made:**

* Alan will act as the full stack manager for security policies while the current manager hires an EM.
* Anti-Abuse product sections will move from SEC to Data Science.
* Data Science will include three existing groups from Model Ops and the Anti-Abuse group.
